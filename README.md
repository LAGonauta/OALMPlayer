# OALMPlayer
Simple OpenAL Music Player

This is a very simple a rough OpenAL Music Player that I coded just to use the X-RAM on mey Creative X-Fi.
It just decodes the sound file in one go and play it.

This software uses NAudio, NAudio.FLAC, NAudio.WindowsMedia, NAudio.Vorbis and OpenTK.

KNOWN BUGS:
- OGG playback is buggy
